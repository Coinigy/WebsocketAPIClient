# Coinigy Websocket API SocketCluster Client

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Nuget.Core.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoinigyWebsocketClient)

This library wraps all the code required to access the Coinigy websocket SocketCluster realtime api into an easy to use cross platform .NET Netstandard package.

The source can easily be modified for other build targets other than .Netstandard 2.0;

A demo project has been included that demonstrates most uses. Some advanced scenarios are not included as they would not be common and may distract from the overall usability of the library. In such cases you should either use the library and parse the messages yourself or go directly to using the underlying SocketCluster library which in this case is our PureSocketCluster library.
